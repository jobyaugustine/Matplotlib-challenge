# Matplotlib-challenge
#Analysis of the Drugs on the Mice is done and the inferences are documented.

* Mouse ID with duplicate time points are removed.

* Summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen is created.

* Bar graphs are drawn using Pandas's `DataFrame.plot()` and Matplotlib's `pyplot` that shows the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen throughout the course of the study.

* Pie graphs are drawn using both Pandas's `DataFrame.plot()` and Matplotlib's `pyplot` that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.

* Final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin is calculated.

* Quartiles and IQR are calculated.

* Box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens is drawn.

* Line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for mouse ID b742 treated with Capomulin is plotted.

* Scatter plot is drawn for tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen.

*  Correlation coefficient is calculated.
*  Linear regression model is plotted.
